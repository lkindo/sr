## 2024-05-23 - IDOR Vulnerability in SR Actions
**Vulnerability:** `getSRAction` and related server actions allowed any authenticated user to retrieve SR details by ID without authorization checks.
**Learning:** Server Actions are public endpoints. Even if they are called "internally" by client components, they can be invoked directly. Simply checking for authentication is not enough; authorization against the specific resource (ID) is mandatory.
**Prevention:** Always verify ownership or permission on the retrieved resource before returning it in a Server Action. Use `ensureCanRead...` policies immediately after fetching the resource.
